                <h3>Virtual Reality</h3>
                <p>The process is very simple in principle. The patient puts on VR glasses and is shown scenes via an app that place him more and more in a situation that seems threatening to him. Scenes can be, for example, an elevator, an airplane or a subway, which is increasingly being filled with passengers. The patient decides for himself how far he wants to go. In the worst case, a panic attack cannot be ruled out, but there is always the possibility of tearing your glasses off your head.</p>

              <h3>Our Therapy</h3>
              <p>The Invirto app is a smartphone application for Android and iOS and the digital image of psychotherapy for anxiety disorders. This is exactly why the Invirto app is structured like a classic therapy as a course with different goals and content. You complete course units one after the other, which teach you the most effective content from various experts for the treatment of anxiety disorders. Invirto provides you with content in the form of a course with units that build on each other. In the app, just like in normal psychotherapy, you will find lessons in which, like in a therapy session, information is conveyed and certain aspects of fear are reflected on. Finally, you can experiment with strategies against fear. Just like you would do in classic therapy.

                <h3>Business Model</h3>
                <p>One area of ​​application that Sympatient is already marketing is fear of flying. Under sicherfliegen.de can order for the app concerned a VR headset and an access code. Otherwise, the startup is still in the process of finding the business model and sales channels. In the long term, funding from health insurers is certainly the goal. Sympatient is already receiving support from many sides.
